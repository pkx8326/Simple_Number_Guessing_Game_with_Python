# Simple_Number_Guessing_Game_with_Python
This repository contains a set of simple Python code for a simple number guessing game. The player guesses a number between 1 - 100 and the game tells the player if the number is too high or too low, until the player gets the number right. There are two levels for the game: easy and hard for 10 and 5 guesses, respectively.

This simple set of code demonstrate the use of if-else statement, randomization, and the use of global variable in Python programming.
